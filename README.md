After half a decade in cloud infrastucture (Pivotal, VMware, Broadcom), I have worked in the aerospace industry for the last year (Hadrian, Long Wall).

On the side, I‚Äôve been chipping away at crafting [PortfolioTree](https://portfoliotree.com), a service that models investment portfolios and excels at analyzing composite portfolio risks (like 401(k), IRA, and HSA). 

Contact me if you have an interesting opportunity for someone who:
- Has been a Gopher ([Go Programming Language](https://go.dev/) Software Developer) since 2015
- Enjoys [üçê **pair programming**]([https://www.pivotaltracker.com/blog/how-pair-programming-and-mob-programming-help-quickly-onboard-new-software-engineers](https://web.archive.org/web/20250218001905/https://www.pivotaltracker.com/blog/how-pair-programming-and-mob-programming-help-quickly-onboard-new-software-engineers)) and practicing test-driven development
- Is experienced with [BOSH](https://bosh.io/docs/) and has contributed to [Cloud Foundry](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/) since 2018

Most of my personal repositories are for-fun projects, so please use them at your own risk (check out their license files). If you find something useful, I'd really appreciate a star!

Feel free to reach out if you‚Äôd like to collaborate on a project, talk about software architecture, or explore other consulting opportunities.

### Current Side Projects
- [Natalie Hunter's Art Website](https://nataliehunterart.com/): A small site I built for my sister‚Äôs art.
- [Playground (Go+WASM)](https://github.com/crhntr/playground): A playground for Go where compiled code runs in your browser.

#### Utilities
- [(Masterminds) semver checker](https://crhntr.com/semver): Play around with semantic version constraints, similar to how you might experiment with regex on Regex101. Planning to add other semantic version libraries in the future.

Thanks again for visiting my profile!

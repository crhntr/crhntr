### Worked at [Pivotal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pivotal_Software)   (2018-07 to 2019-12)

This was my first real job out of college. I found out about Pivotal from the [Go Time](https://changelog.com/gotime) podcast and applied at a recuriting event.

I worked on two teams:

1. The first was Infrastructure (7ish months). We built tooling to setup and configure BOSH directors on various infrastructure as service providers: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure, and VMWare's VSphere. We heavily used Terraform and wrote a **bunch** of YAML and a fair bit of bash.

1. The second was Pivotal Application Service Release (11 months). We tested and integrated components from 20+ teams and built tools to automate the release process.

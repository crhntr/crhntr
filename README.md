### Work at [VMWare](https://www.vmware.com)   (2020-01 to present)

I'm currently working at VMWare on the [App Autoscaler](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/2-10/appsman-services/autoscaler/about-app-autoscaler.html) and [Scheduler](https://docs.pivotal.io/scheduler/1-2/) for [VMWare Tanzu Application Service](https://tanzu.vmware.com/application-service).

### Work at [Pivotal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pivotal_Software)   (2018-07 to 2019-12)

This was my first real job out of college. I found out about Pivotal from the [Go Time](https://changelog.com/gotime) podcast and applied at a recuriting event.

The interview process was so much fun. I did my remote pairing interview (Rob's Pairing Interview) in remotely over Zoom and during the interview learned some stuff about TDD that I was able to use on my final coding assignments. Two weeks later, I interviewed on site at the Santa Monica office. I had just graduated the Saturday before and then spent the rest of the weekend cramming for a whiteboard interview... that didn't happen. The Pivotal on site interview was a pairing interview. I paired with two Pivot's on stories from their backlog (in Go ðŸ¤©). I was able to get a good sense of what working at Pivotal would be like. I was so excited when I accepted their offer. [Some teams at VMWare might still interview like this](https://rolp.co/ttM3j).

My time at Pivotal was great for so many reasons. One particularly strong reason was the management practice. My manager would take an hour (or more) every week to talk about whatever I was struggling with or had questions about. We would usually cover logistics for a few minutes and then just bounce around various topics. I was introduced to everything from how systems thinking and refactoring to some of the best coffee (and donut) shops in Santa Monica. We often talked about how to be better allies and how our labor was impacting those around us. While my manager had a huge impact on me, I also really appreciated the feedback and conversations with the rest of the engineering and product leadership.

I worked on two teams:

1. The first was Infrastructure (7ish months). We built tooling to setup and configure BOSH directors on various infrastructure as service providers: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure, and VMWare's VSphere. We heavily used Terraform and wrote a **bunch** of YAML and a fair bit of bash.

1. The second was Pivotal Application Service Release (11 months). We tested and integrated components from 20+ teams and built tools to automate the release process. Around the time I joined the team we had 10+ members and were shipping a set of patch releases every month or two and were not making much progress on tooling. A year later, we were shipping consistently whenever we wanted (usually every two weeks but as shorter if we wanted) with two engineers working on the actual release pipelines and the rest working on better tooling and improving the customer experience. I learned so many important lessons about systems thinking, refactoring, inclusivity, meeting facilitation, product management, and lean development from the people on this team.

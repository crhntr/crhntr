## Holla, Hello, –ü—Ä–∏–≤—ñ—Ç, Bok üëã 
[![Pronouns: He/Him](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pronouons-He/Him-lightgrey)](https://www.mypronouns.org/he-him)

- I like to [üçê **pair program**](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/blog/how-pair-programming-and-mob-programming-help-quickly-onboard-new-software-engineers), practice test driven development, and refactor.
- I've been a gopher ([Go](https://golang.org/) developer) since 2015.
- I've volunteered for [Black Girls Code](https://www.blackgirlscode.com/). If you want to empower the next generation of technologists, check this organization out.
- We may have met at KubeCon 2019. I spent most of my time at the Pivotal booth or at the snack tables.

### Current side-projects
- [Curtis Capital](https://curtis.capital): portfolio analysis and other financial tooling developed in collaboration with [Blake Curitis](https://github.com/curtisbw).
- [Natalie Hunter's Art Website](https://nataliehunterart.com/). I built my sister a little website for her art.

### I work for [VMWare](https://www.vmware.com) (previously Pivotal Inc.) - 2018 to present

- I improve the Platform Provider (Operator) Experience for organizations using [Tanzu Application Service for VMs](https://tanzu.vmware.com/application-service).
- I've also worked on [App Autoscaler](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/2-10/appsman-services/autoscaler/about-app-autoscaler.html) and [Scheduler](https://docs.pivotal.io/scheduler/1-2/).

### Importing stuff from my repos

My personal repos have a few different licenses, if you'd like to import code from one them and license does not work for your usage, reach out to me.

Also for U.S. based folks, I did not mark up every one of my repos with export control. Please make sure if you import code from one of my repos, that you are doing appropriate due diligence on the legal stuffs around encryption.

My personal repos are (mostly) for-fun projects... use at your own risk (see license files).

- I like to [**pair program**](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/blog/how-pair-programming-and-mob-programming-help-quickly-onboard-new-software-engineers), practice test driven development, and regularly refactor.
- I enjoy coding with friends for fun
  - Feel free to @ me for in your (for fun or positive social impact) repos.
  - If you'd like to pair on interview prep or solving fun data structures/algorithms problems over Zoom, message me.
- Go developer since 1.3 (late 2014).
  - At work, I support a few components, written in Go, for Tanzu Application Service.
  - I like playing with Go in the browser using WebAssembly.
  - My most controversial opinion is I wish the Go generics syntax used parens instead of brackets. "Type parameters" are parameters and a syntax representing this idea would have been elegant.
- Occationally, I volunteer for [Black Girls Code](https://www.blackgirlscode.com/). If you want to empower the next generation of technologists, check this organization out.
- We may have met at KubeCon 2019. I spent most of my time at the Pivotal booth or in the release engineering track (and at the tea/snack tables).

### Work at [VMWare](https://www.vmware.com)   (2020-01 to present)

I'm currently working at VMWare on the [App Autoscaler](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/2-10/appsman-services/autoscaler/about-app-autoscaler.html) and [Scheduler](https://docs.pivotal.io/scheduler/1-2/) for [VMWare Tanzu Application Service](https://tanzu.vmware.com/application-service).

**Catch the upcoming talk at VMWorld to see what I have been up to.**

### Worked at [Pivotal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pivotal_Software)   (2018-07 to 2019-12)

This was my first real job out of college. I found out about Pivotal from the [Go Time](https://changelog.com/gotime) podcast and applied at a recuriting event.

I worked on two teams:

1. The first was Infrastructure (7ish months). We built tooling to setup and configure BOSH directors on various infrastructure as service providers: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure, and VMWare's VSphere. We heavily used Terraform and wrote a **bunch** of YAML and a fair bit of bash.

1. The second was Pivotal Application Service Release (11 months). We tested and integrated components from 20+ teams and built tools to automate the release process.

### Importing stuff from my repos

My personal repos have a few different licences, if you'd like to import code from one them and licence does not work for your usage, reach out to me.

Also for U.S. based folks, I did not mark up every one of my repos with export control. Please make sure if you import code from one of my repos, that you are doing appropriate due diligence on the legal stuffs around encryption.

My personal repos are (mostly) for-fun projects... use at your own risk (see licence files).

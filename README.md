## Holla ðŸ‘‹

- I use "he" series pronouns.
- I like to **pair program**, practice test driven development, and regularly refactor.
- Let me know if you'd like to pair on interview prep or solving fun data structures/algorithms problems over Zoom.
- Go developer since 1.3 (late 2014).
  - I like playing with Go in the browser using WebAssembly.
  - My most controversial opinion is I wish the Go generics syntax used parens instead of brackets. "Type parameters" are parameters and a syntax representing this idea would have been elegant.
- Occationally, I volunteer for [Black Girls Code](https://www.blackgirlscode.com/). If you want to empower the next generation of technologists, check this organization out.

### Worked at [Pivotal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pivotal_Software)   (2018-07 to 2019-12)

This was my first real job out of college. I found out about Pivotal from the [Go Time](https://changelog.com/gotime) podcast and applied at a recuriting event.

I worked on two teams:

1. The first was Infrastructure (7ish months). We built tooling to setup and configure BOSH directors on various infrastructure as service providers: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure, and VMWare's VSphere. We heavily used Terraform and wrote a **bunch** of YAML and a fair bit of bash.

1. The second was Pivotal Application Service Release (11 months). We tested and integrated components from 20+ teams and built tools to automate the release process.
